    "Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic disease where the bile ducts in the liver slowly get damaged and destroyed, thus leading to liver damage. It is one of the major causes of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Various factors affect the prognosis of PBC which is crucial in effectively treating patients (Prince et al., 2002). Ascites, which is the build-up of fluid in abdominal regions, is one of the major complications of advanced PBC (Purohit, 2015). In this project, we want to evaluate the effect of this complication on the prognosis of patients administered with D-penicillamine. This drug, although used, does not have any known efficacy (Purohit, 2015). We chose to analyze this to provide better insights into effectively treating patients. Therefore, with this project, we are asking the following question:"

    "The reason we chose the difference in proportions is because the above two variables are discrete and thus have only two possible outcomes for each variable. Thus, we can compare the amount of patients for each discrete value with the total number of patients. The reason we chose standard error as we are using proportions and would like to calculate how much our statistic will differ from the population proportion."
